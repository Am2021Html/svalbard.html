				    <li> Coronavirus / Health chief welcomes ‘proportionate’ change to Covid rules </li>

NHS Shetland chief executive Michael Dickson says the newly announced phased change to Covid rules is a “welcome and cautious step forward”.

But he warned that the pandemic is “absolutely not over”.

From 21 March the legal requirement for people to wear face coverings in certain settings will be downgraded to voluntary guidance as part of a strategy to ‘live with Covid’.

The Covid passport scheme will also end from Monday, unless venues want to run it voluntarily, and people will be asked to carry out lateral flow tests less often.

Speaking in response to first minister Nicola Sturgeon’s announcement on Tuesday, Dickson said: “I think this is a welcome and cautious step forward in terms of how we manage the next stages of the pandemic, presuming that nothing else changes, because there may well be a new variant that comes down the line.

“I think it’s proportionate and responsive to the situation in Scotland.”

Dickson also said the shift away from a legal requirement to guidance “isn’t that dramatically different”.

When asked if he expects the community to continue wearing masks come 21 March, the health chief said it will come down to a degree of personal judgement.

He said this judgement has been “pretty much spot on” in Shetland during the pandemic.

Dickson added that he understands why some people will be nervous when the rules change, but he pointed to the low numbers of people needing hospital treatment for Covid.

He stressed the guidance is that symptomatic people should continue to isolate, and encouraged people to continue doing the basics like hand washing.

Dickson warned though that the situation in Shetland remains different in terms of case numbers.

The isles continue to have the highest rate of Covid in the country when it comes to population, and more than 80 were reported today.

Interim director of public health Dr Susan Laidlaw reiterated that when it comes to positive results Shetland is still recording a high number of lateral flows compared to PCRs, suggesting people are following the testing guidance.

LOCAL skipper Richard Grains says he was pleased how his new crabber Valentia LK21 performed during her 800-mile journey from Valentia Island, in the southwest of Ireland, to Shetland last week

The new vessel arrived at the Vidlin marina for the naming ceremony at the weekend after successfully dodging Storm Dudley on her four-day journey home.

Built by Murphy Marine Services of Portmagee, the 10-metre vessel is based on the well-established Cygnus Typhoon 33 hulls but has been adapted further to give her more stability and seaworthiness for the rough and exposed waters to the west of Shetland.

			   Abstract
Compared to other Arctic ice masses, Svalbard glaciers are low-elevated with flat interior accumulation areas, resulting in a marked peak in their current hypsometry (area-elevation distribution) at  ~450 m above sea level. Since summer melt consistently exceeds winter snowfall, these low-lying glaciers can only survive by refreezing a considerable fraction of surface melt and rain in the porous firn layer covering their accumulation zones. We use a high-resolution climate model to show that modest atmospheric warming in the mid-1980s forced the firn zone to retreat upward by  ~100 m to coincide with the hypsometry peak. This led to a rapid areal reduction of firn cover available for refreezing, and strongly increased runoff from dark, bare ice areas, amplifying mass loss from all elevations. As the firn line fluctuates around the hypsometry peak in the current climate, Svalbard glaciers will continue to lose mass and show high sensitivity to temperature perturbations.

Introduction
Glaciers and ice caps in the Svalbard archipelago (Fig. 1a) cover an area of  ~34,000 km2, representing about 6% of the world’s glacier area outside the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets1; they contain 7740 ± 1940 km3 (or Gigaton; Gt) of ice, sufficient to raise global sea level by 1.7 ± 0.5 cm if totally melted2. As a result of Arctic Amplification3, in which Arctic warming over the last two decades was twice the global average4, and being situated at the edge of retreating Arctic sea ice, Svalbard ice caps experience among the fastest warming on Earth. Compared to other Arctic ice caps, Svalbard glaciers have relatively low elevations (Fig. 1b). The highest elevation on Svalbard is ~1700 m above sea level (a.s.l.), but the glacier hypsometry (area-elevation distribution) peaks at ~450 m a.s.l. compared to 800–1400 m a.s.l. for ice caps in Greenland, Arctic Canada and Iceland (Fig. 1b). About 60% of the total glacier area of Svalbard is located below that hypsometry peak. Moreover, Svalbard ice caps have relatively flat interior accumulation zones leading to a more pronounced peak compared to other Arctic ice masses (Fig. 1b).
